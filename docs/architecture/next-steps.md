# Next Steps

## For Development

**James (Dev Agent),**

Please review this architecture document and begin implementing **Epic 1, Story 1.1: Project Setup and Development Environment** from the PRD.

Key architecture decisions for your implementation:
1. **Use Poetry for dependency management** - initialize with `poetry init`
2. **Project structure follows the Source Tree section** - create directories as specified
3. **All external API clients must use tenacity retry decorator** - see Error Handling Strategy
4. **SQLAlchemy async engine** - use `create_async_engine` for async/await support
5. **Week 1 spike focus** - validate Anthropic Agent SDK capabilities before building full orchestrator

Start with:
```bash
poetry init
poetry add anthropic httpx python-telegram-bot sqlalchemy python-decouple python-json-logger tenacity
poetry add --group dev pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-mock mypy black ruff
```

Refer to `docs/prd/epic-1-foundation-agent-sdk-validation-spike.md` for story details.
