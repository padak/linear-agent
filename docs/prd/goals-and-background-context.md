# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Learn how to build autonomous AI agents using Anthropic's Agent SDK
- Understand agent patterns: scheduling, persistent memory, tool integration
- Model and optimize LLM costs for production workloads
- Reduce time spent manually checking Linear by 10+ minutes per morning
- Build confidence in deploying autonomous agents to production
- Create a working morning digest that surfaces 3-10 relevant Linear issues (blocked, stale, active)
- Validate that the agent runs reliably for 7+ consecutive days without crashes

## Background Context

This is a personal learning project to explore Anthropic's Agent SDK by solving a real problem: maintaining awareness across Linear issues without spending 1-2 hours daily on manual checking. The problem involves tracking 10-30 active issues across multiple teams, catching blocked or stale items before they impact timelines, and reducing the cognitive load of constant context-switching.

The timing is ideal because Anthropic's Agent SDK (2024-2025) represents a significant shift in autonomous AI system architecture. Building a real monitoring agent provides hands-on experience with critical agent patterns while creating immediate personal utility. This is NOT a commercial productâ€”success means deeply understanding Agent SDK capabilities AND building something useful, even if briefings are imperfect.
