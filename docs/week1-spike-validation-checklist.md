# Week 1 Spike: Agent SDK Validation Checklist

## Purpose

Validate whether Anthropic Agent SDK provides value over plain Claude Messages API for Linear Chief of Staff MVP.

## Validation Tests

### 1. Basic Inference Test

**Capability:** Generate briefing from Linear issues

**Test:**
```python
issues = fetch_test_issues(count=10)
briefing = agent_sdk.generate_briefing(issues)
assert len(briefing) > 0
assert "ENG-" in briefing  # Contains issue IDs
```

**Pass Criteria:** Generates coherent briefing with issue summaries

**Result:** ⬜ Pass / ⬜ Fail

---

### 2. Response Quality Test

**Capability:** 1-2 sentence summaries per issue (FR6)

**Test:** Validate each issue summary ≤ 200 characters

**Pass Criteria:** ≥ 90% of summaries meet length requirement

**Result:** ⬜ Pass / ⬜ Fail

**Measured:** ___ % of summaries within 200 characters

---

### 3. Cost Comparison Test

**Capability:** Token efficiency vs. Messages API

**Test:**
```python
# Test with same 50-issue payload
sdk_tokens = agent_sdk.generate_briefing(issues).token_count
msg_api_tokens = messages_api.generate_briefing(issues).token_count
cost_ratio = sdk_tokens / msg_api_tokens
```

**Pass Criteria:** SDK uses ≤ 1.2x tokens of Messages API (max 20% overhead acceptable)

**Result:** ⬜ Pass / ⬜ Fail

**Measured:**
- SDK tokens: ___
- Messages API tokens: ___
- Ratio: ___ (Target: ≤ 1.20)
- Cost difference: ___ %

---

### 4. Latency Test

**Capability:** <30s briefing generation (NFR1)

**Test:** Generate briefing with 50 issues, measure end-to-end time

**Pass Criteria:** ≤ 30 seconds for 50 issues

**Result:** ⬜ Pass / ⬜ Fail

**Measured:** ___ seconds (Target: ≤ 30s)

---

### 5. Context Retention Test (Optional)

**Capability:** Multi-turn conversation context

**Test:** Not needed for MVP (defer to Phase 2)

**Result:** ⬜ N/A (Defer to Phase 2)

**Rationale:** MVP focuses on single-turn briefing generation

---

### 6. Scheduling Test (Optional)

**Capability:** Native SDK scheduling

**Test:** Check if SDK provides cron-like scheduling API

**Pass Criteria:** SDK has built-in scheduler that can trigger at specific times

**Result:** ⬜ Pass / ⬜ Fail / ⬜ N/A

**Note:** APScheduler is locked-in choice, this is informational only

---

### 7. Memory Persistence Test (Optional)

**Capability:** SDK-managed persistent memory

**Test:** Check if SDK provides memory store that persists across invocations

**Pass Criteria:** SDK has built-in memory that survives process restarts

**Result:** ⬜ Pass / ⬜ Fail / ⬜ N/A

**Note:** SQLite is locked-in choice for agent context, this is informational only

---

## Decision Matrix

| Tests Passed | Decision |
|--------------|----------|
| 1-4 all pass | ✅ **Use Agent SDK** - Meets quality, cost, and performance requirements |
| 1-2 pass, 3-4 fail | ⚠️ **Use Messages API** - SDK has cost/latency issues |
| 1-2 fail | 🚫 **Use Messages API** - SDK doesn't meet basic quality requirements |

---

## Implementation Decision

**Tests Completed:** __/4 core tests

**Tests Passed:** __/4

**Decision:** ⬜ Use Agent SDK / ⬜ Use Messages API / ⬜ Needs More Testing

**Rationale:**

[Document reasoning here after completing tests]

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Update `components.md` with final decision
- [ ] Configure `USE_AGENT_SDK` in `.env.example`
- [ ] Implement chosen path in `BriefingAgent` class

---

## Fallback Strategy

If Agent SDK chosen but fails in production:

1. Set `USE_AGENT_SDK=False` in `.env`
2. Agent automatically falls back to Messages API (factory pattern)
3. No code changes required (interface abstraction)

### Fallback Validation Checklist

- [ ] Implement factory pattern supporting both SDK and Messages API
- [ ] Test switching between implementations at runtime
- [ ] Verify no data loss or state corruption during fallback
- [ ] Document switchover procedure in runbook

---

## Success Criteria Summary

**MVP Readiness Gate (All must pass):**
- ✅ Test 1 (Basic Inference) passes
- ✅ Test 2 (Response Quality) passes
- ✅ Test 3 or 4 (Cost or Latency) acceptable
- ✅ Decision documented with rationale
- ✅ Fallback strategy validated

**Week 1 Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] All 4 core tests executed
- [ ] Decision documented with reasoning
- [ ] Fallback strategy implemented and tested
- [ ] Cost modeling updated with actual token counts
- [ ] Implementation path chosen and communicated

---

## Notes

**Test Data Requirements:**
- 10-issue sample set (Test 1)
- 50-issue production-size set (Tests 3-4)
- Linear issues from real workspace preferred
- Diverse issue types (bugs, features, documentation)

**Measurement Tools:**
- Use Anthropic Token Counter for accurate token counts
- Use Python `time.perf_counter()` for latency measurements
- Run each test minimum 3 times, report average
- Document test date and environment

**Decision Escalation:**
If results are mixed (2 tests pass, 2 fail), escalate to:
- Product Manager: Business impact of cost difference
- Engineering Lead: Feasibility of Messages API approach
- Timeline: Potential impact on Week 1 completion

**Document Status:** Ready for Week 1 spike execution

**Last Updated:** [Execution date]

**Next Review:** Post-testing analysis and decision documentation
